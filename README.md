To build the project you will need to get the cards from the Google Drive folder linked from the above threads first post.
Then place them in the folders as follows:

Extract the "Hi-Res Cards.zip" from https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0BzpR1-5sN2wAVE9kYWZsOVZsX1k 

Place the contents of the "Mission" folder in "Assets\RAEV2 Assets\Resources\Mission" (including folder structure). 
You should end up with a folder for each mission set. Each of which will contain front and back images for all cards in the set.

Place the contents of the "AE" folder in "Assets\RAEV2 Assets\Resources\AE" EXCEPT for the blitz card and the card back. 
You should end up with the following set of AE cards in the folder:
Green 1 - Green 6
Red 1 - Red 6
Gold 1 - Gold 6
Blue 1 - Blue 6

The blitz card and AE card back are already in the project. If they need updating they are in "Assets\RAEV2 Assets\Cards"



Controls:
Clicking the AE decks draw pile draws the next card. 
Clicking the discard pile to go in reverse if you accidentally double click the draw pile.
Use the drop downs on the bottom right to choose the mission card. Select a set then a mission.
Click the mission card to switch back and forth between the front and back of the mission card.
